FreshWind is to be a Content Management System or also called CMS. FreshWind is
planned to function simular to some other open source CMSs - stability like: 
PostNuke, XOOPS, Drupal & simpleness like: WordPress and theming like: Joomla

This will be a very hard task to begin with, so we may start working on the last
 release of PostNuke as a base. Then maybe (or during the reactoring of PN) changing
the languages to function like they do with Drupal. After which and during the 
process of redevelopment of PN we would need to fix the theming to something 
simular to what is used within Drupal or Joomla.

Anyone willing to help get this project up is welcomed to email me <asmadius@ok.de>,
 you can send the email in english or german (I read and Write both). Any other 
languages will be translated online and may not be translated correctly.

A page will be added to include any contibutors to this project, if we do get 
any sponsors the will have an attrution page, as well as anyone donating will 
have a choice of being added to the attribution page for them

A website containing NEWS, FORUMS, DOWNLOADS, FAQ, WIKI and more @ www.freshwind.tk
is (at this point) in the pocess of being setup.
